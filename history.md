# history of the "streamer website"

The streamer website which fulfills the [**corporate decoupling principle**](https://github.com/streamforthepeople/philosophy#core-principles) is not a new idea. The streamer [Destiny](destiny.gg) started their streamer website in [2013](https://github.com/destinygg/website/commit/0fcd5fbe5adfdab1e1392bb79924c09760eac5a4) and only [recently (late 2021)](https://github.com/destinygg/website/commit/4f4077671080bb9449435a8bb29f4379eb19a605) stopped publicly maintaining the repository (see discussion of [open source](https://github.com/streamforthepeople/philosophy#open-source-todo) in the context of the streamer website). [In early 2019](https://github.com/ILiedAboutCake/blog/blob/master/content/posts/04-22-2021-a-timeline-of-destinygg-website-and-forks.md#vaush-and-whiteleaf-sites), Destiny's open source streamer website was forked by [WhiteNervosa](https://github.com/WhiteNervosa) to service another streamer, [Vaush](vaush.gg); this fork ultimately culminated in another (and likely the first) streamer website as a service, [WhiteLe.af](https://www.whitefore.st/), whose goal is ["to provide [a] free and open source accessible platform for content creators"](https://www.whitefore.st/) (however, note that [it is not currently open source](https://github.com/WhiteNervosa/WhiteNervosa/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L8); see discussion of [open source](https://github.com/streamforthepeople/philosophy#open-source-todo) in the context of the streamer website). WhiteLe.af now powers the streamer websites of multiple streamers ([~25](https://www.whitefore.st/)) and is the primary model for [**streamforthepeople**](https://streamforthepeople.com), which covers many of WhiteLe.af's features, adds more, and does so in a way that is **massively scalable and easy to manage/modify** ([cloud native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing), [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) orchestrated, [asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)) [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) with [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD), ergonomically written in [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) + [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/)). As a result, [**streamforthepeople**](https://streamforthepeople.com) offers a service fulfilling the **corporate decoupling principle** to **as many streamers as possible**, making it the ideal service for fulfilling the **ownership transfer priniciple**.
