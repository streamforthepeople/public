streamforthepeople uses stripe as a payment processor, specifically, we use stripe connect standard accounts

stripe connect standard accounts allow platforms (like streamforthepeople) to create and react to transactions made between platform users (the streamers) and their customers (the viewers). this means **there are no payouts, your viewers pay you directly**; stripe connect will automatically extract streamforthepeople's cut from each transaction.

# refunds
We do not offer refunds (for now). Do not manually refund transactions from the stripe dashboard. If someone disputes a transaction, do not refund them, streamforthepeople will help you fight the dispute.
