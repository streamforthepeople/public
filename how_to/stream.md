1. join the [streamforthepeople discord](https://discord.gg/mxZqFgqD)
1. DM `avi#3830` that you would like your own streamer website; note that using the service requires between a 20-2000 viewer average, this range will widen as the service matures
1. we will work with you to verify that you truly own the account that you stream from
1. after confirming account ownership, we will give you permission to onboard to stripe, which processes our [payments](../about/payments.md), initiate onboarding from any streamforthepeople user box (TODO add screenshot)
1. you will also get a `stream creation token`, which will allow you to create a stream after you have successfully onboarded to stripe, create a stream using the button in any streamforthepeople user box (TODO add screenshot)
1. after you have successfully created a stream, your browser should automatically initialize streamforthepeople stripe objects (for donations, the various tiers of subscriptions, and their corresponding prices)
1. your stream has now successfully been created and can be accessed at `https://streamforthepeople.com/{stream_id}` (set a custom domain in the next step)
1. now you have access to all stream owner endpoints and can do things like add chats, customize the look of your site, set a custom domain, etc.
